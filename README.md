## About me

I'm Sarah, a 3rd year undergrad studying CS+math. I'm involved in a lot of seemingly unrelated research, tied together by a faint interest in math and a passion for creating. Outside of research, I play violin and help lead the Columbia Robotics Club.

### Current research

ðŸ§© **MOSES** | Columbia Gang Lab

A foundational algorithm applying the group theoretic concept of 'symmetry' to chemical engineering. An information-minimizing method for to designing self-assembling DNA origami nanoparticle lattices. Under supervision of Dr. Jason Kahn at Brookhaven and Dr. Oleg Gang at Columbia University. Our paper was accepted to ACS Nano!

ðŸŽ» **Synchrony** | NYU Dennis Shasha Group

An opinionated practice tool for musicians, which compares a user's recording to a MIDI score and computes the user's mistakes in real-time. Uses a probabilistic pitch detection method that utilizes the MIDI to detect note events. Under supervision of the kind NYU professor Dennis Shasha.

ðŸ§¬ **RichCluster** | UND Hur Lab

An Rcpp library for performing hierarchical clustering on multiple enriched genomics datasets. Clusters different biological 'terms' based on overlapping gene content. Coded in C++ for fast clustering, with customizable linkage / distance metrics and supporting visualizations. (Paper-in-progress)
