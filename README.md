## About Me

I'm Sarah, a 3rd year undergrad studying CS+math. I love art and music! Underlying most of what I do is an appreciation for the art of building and creating.

### Current Research

ðŸ§© **MOSES** | Columbia Gang Lab

An algorithm for finding the optimal # of unique voxel + DNA bonds to enable the self-assembly of a DNA nanoparticle lattice structure. Under supervision of Dr. Jason Kahn at Brookhaven and Dr. Oleg Gang at Columbia University. Our paper was submitted to ACS Nano!

ðŸŽ» **virtuOS** | NYU Dennis Shasha Group

A computational practice tool for musicians. Tracks the user's pitch over time and compares it to the MIDI score of the piece, and gives feedback on rhythm, intonation, and style. Implements PYIN algorithm for pitch detection, and a modified version of the Levenshtein string edit algorithm for MIDI-audio alignment / feedback. Under supervision of the kind NYU professor Dennis Shasha.

ðŸ§¬ **RichCluster** | UND Hur Lab

A tool to cluster different biological 'terms' based on overlapping gene content. Coded in C++ for fast clustering, with customizable linkage / distance metrics and supporting visualizations, exported into an R package. (Paper-in-progress)
