## About Me

I'm Sarah, a 3rd year undergrad studying CS+math. I love art and music! Underlying most of what I do is an appreciation for the art of building and creating.

### Current Research

ðŸ§© **CHROMAssembly** | Columbia Gang Lab

An algorithm for finding the optimal # of unique voxel + DNA bonds to enable the self-assembly of a DNA nanoparticle lattice structure. Under supervision of Dr. Jason Kahn at Brookhaven and Dr. Oleg Gang at Columbia University.

ðŸŽ» **virtuOS** | NYU Dennis Shasha Group

A computational practice tool for musicians. Tracks the user's pitch over time and compares it to the MIDI score of the piece, and gives feedback on rhythm, intonation, and style. Implements PYIN algorithm for pitch detection, and dynamic time warping for MIDI-audio alignment. Under supervision of the kind NYU professor Dennis Shasha.
